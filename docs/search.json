    "text": "I am a geographer and data analyst who uses remote sensing and GIS to explore the relationships between snow and our changing climate.\nAs an undergraduate at Green Mountain College I fell in love with GIS and its power to help provide quality data to support more informed management decisions by stakeholders. I took this passion further when I worked on a team to study vegetation and water resource disturbance in support of a bison management strategy as part of a NASA DEVELOP project in the summer of 2018. This project both inspired me to begin thinking about the possibility of pursuing graduate research as well as gave me an introduction to the excitement of remote sensing. Over the next 2 years I worked as a Cartographic Technician for the U.S. Census Bureau, gaining an appreciation for social and economic geography as well as the importance of considering how people are impacted by policy. In April 2021 I was able to get back to my environmental roots by joining University of Vermont’s Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL). At the SAL I worked on a variety of remote sensing projects, largely urban tree canopy (UTC) and land cover mapping projects. During my last year at the SAL, I was able to lead the editing effort on two wetlands mapping projects. This was a new challenge for me and introduced me to the intricacies of wetlands mapping and project management.\nAs a Masters student at the University of Nevada Reno (UNR) I modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) and used SHAP to identify how key predictors of peak SWE vary across different regions of the Western US and Alaska. This experience helped me come to love the process of working through challenging research problems and independently designing workflows for analyzing large, complex datasets.\nI’m currently open to opportunities in either geospatial analysis/remote sensing or sports analytics and am willing to relocate if necessary, so feel free to reach out to me either via email or Linkedin!"

    "text": "The full text can be found here and below is the abstract.\n\nSnowpack is a critical water resource threatened by climate change. This is particularly true in the western United States. NASA’s SnowEx program measured snow cover at numerous sites in the western United States and Alaska in preparation for future space-based missions. These snow cover sites were chosen largely based on snow cover classes created using subjectively defined thresholds. However, there has not been a systematic classification of snow cover in the US or SnowEx sites in terms of variables that affect snow water equivalent (SWE). Random Forest is a machine learning method that uses groups of decision trees to create robust predictions and identify important variables. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanatory Values) is a modeling framework which uses game theory to evaluate the local importances of different predictors in a model by estimating their contributions in different coalitions of predictors. Using these advanced machine learning methods, I have created new snow cover classifications for the western United States and Alaska based on key predictor variables of peak SWE for Water Years 1993-2020 and assessed the representativeness of SnowEx sites in terms of these classes. These new snow classes are compared with the snow cover classification system created by Sturm and Liston (2021). This work will help NASA identify data gaps and enhance future snow monitoring efforts."

    "text": "Vortex of Accuracy\nAs part of my passion for sports analytics, I made what I call the Vortex of Accuracy (VoA). I call it that because I think it’s fun and silly, but believe me it is a serious statistical modeling effort. The VoA is a series of team strength models that I’ve created for FBS College Football and the NFL. These models take a combination of season summary stats and play-by-play data and attempt to approximate the projected win margin for each team against the hypothetical average team in their competition on a neutral field. The code for these models is written in R and Stan."
